# LangGraph

LangGraph is a powerful Python framework for building **stateful, multi-branch conversational agents** using graphs. It extends LangChain by introducing a graph-based approach to control conversation flow, enabling developers to design agents with memory, branching logic, and complex control structures.

LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents.

## Features

- **Graph-based Conversation Flow**: Define nodes and edges to model multi-step, branching interactions.
- **Stateful Agents**: Maintain memory and context across conversation turns.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with LangChain and popular LLMs.
- **Customizable Logic**: Supports conditional branching, looping, and complex agent orchestration.

## Use Cases

- Customer support chatbots with dynamic branching.
- Complex multi-agent systems with defined interaction rules.
- Conversational workflows with memory and history tracking.
- Task automation agents that require structured control flow.
